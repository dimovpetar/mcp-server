            ␊
            <code>Element</code> is the most basic building block for UI5 UIs. An <code>Element</code> has state like a <code>ManagedObject</code>, it has a unique ID by which the framework remembers it. It can have associated DOM, but it can't render itself. Only {@link sap.ui.core.Control Controls} can render themselves and also take care of rendering <code>Elements</code> that they aggregate as children. If an <code>Element</code> has been rendered, its related DOM gets the same ID as the <code>Element</code> and thereby can be retrieved via API. When the state of an <code>Element</code> changes, it informs its parent <code>Control</code> which usually re-renders then.␊
            ␊
            <h3>Dispatching Events</h3>␊
            ␊
            The UI5 framework already registers generic listeners for common browser events, such as <code>click</code> or <code>keydown</code>. When called, the generic listener first determines the corresponding target element using {@link jQuery#control}. Then it checks whether the element has an event handler method for the event. An event handler method by convention has the same name as the event, but prefixed with "on": Method <code>onclick</code> is the handler for the <code>click</code> event, method <code>onkeydown</code> the handler for the <code>keydown</code> event and so on. If there is such a method, it will be called with the original event as the only parameter. If the element has a list of delegates registered, their handler functions will be called the same way, where present. The set of implemented handlers might differ between element and delegates. Not each handler implemented by an element has to be implemented by its delegates, and delegates can implement handlers that the corresponding element doesn't implement.␊
            ␊
            A list of browser events that are handled that way can be found in {@link module:sap/ui/events/ControlEvents}. Additionally, the framework dispatches pseudo events ({@link module:sap/ui/events/PseudoEvents}) using the same naming convention. Last but not least, some framework events are also dispatched that way, e.g. <code>BeforeRendering</code>, <code>AfterRendering</code> (only for controls) and <code>ThemeChanged</code>.␊
            ␊
            If further browser events are needed, controls can register listeners on the DOM using native APIs in their <code>onAfterRendering</code> handler. If needed, they can do this for their aggregated elements as well. If events might fire often (e.g. <code>mousemove</code>), it is best practice to register them only while needed, and deregister afterwards. Anyhow, any registered listeners must be cleaned up in the <code>onBeforeRendering</code> listener and before destruction in the <code>exit</code> hook.`,

            text: `# Guide for Migrating the Deprecated \`sap.ui.controller\` Function␊
            ␊
            > *This guide provides instructions for AI-based development tools to perform a critical API migration in SAPUI5 projects. The focus is on replacing the deprecated \`sap.ui.controller\` with modern, asynchronous-friendly equivalents.*␊
            ␊
            ## 1. Core Concepts of the Migration␊
            ␊
            The global function \`sap.ui.controller\` was used for two distinct purposes: defining a controller class and synchronously instantiating a controller. Both use cases are now deprecated and must be replaced to align with modern UI5 development standards, which emphasize Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) for improved performance and modularity.␊
            ␊
            The migration path involves these primary steps:␊
            ␊
            1. **Adopt \`sap.ui.define\`:** All controller definitions must be wrapped in a \`sap.ui.define\` block. This ensures that dependencies, like the base controller, are loaded asynchronously before the controller module is executed.␊
            2. **Import \`sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller\`:** The modern base class for all controllers must be explicitly imported.␊
            3. **Choose the Correct Replacement:**␊
                * To **define a controller class**, use \`Controller.extend()\`. This is the most common use case and is typically found in \`.controller.js\` files.␊
                * To **create an instance of a controller** programmatically (a less common scenario), use the factory function \`Controller.create()\`. This function returns a \`Promise\`.␊
            ␊
            ## 2. Migration Scenarios␊
            ␊
            ### Scenario A: Defining a Controller Class (Most Common)␊
            ␊
            This scenario applies to the standard definition of a view's controller. The goal is to convert the old \`sap.ui.controller()\` definition into a modern AMD-style module that returns a controller class.␊
            ␊
            **Key Characteristics of "Before" Code:**␊
            ␊
            * Uses \`sap.ui.controller('my.name.space.ControllerName', { ... });\`␊
            * The code is often in the global scope, not inside a \`sap.ui.define\`.␊
            * Contains lifecycle methods like \`onInit\`, \`onAfterRendering\`, etc.␊
            ␊
            #### Migration Steps␊
            ␊
            1. Wrap the entire code in a \`sap.ui.define\` call.␊
            2. Add \`"sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller"\` to the dependency array.␊
            3. Pass a corresponding argument (e.g., \`Controller\`) to the factory function.␊
            4. Replace \`sap.ui.controller(...)\` with \`return Controller.extend(...)\`.␊
            5. It's a best practice to add \`"use strict";\` as the first statement inside the factory function. This should only be done if this practice is done in other controller files in the project.␊
            ␊
            ␊
            #### Example: Controller Class Migration␊
            ␊
            **Before:**␊
            ␊
            \`\`\`js␊
            sap.ui.controller('myApp.controller.Main', {␊
                onInit: function () {␊
                    // Initialization code␊
                },␊
                onPress: function () {␊
                    // Button press handler␊
                },␊
            });␊
            \`\`\`␊
            ␊
            **After:**␊
            ␊
            \`\`\`js␊
            sap.ui.define([␊
                "sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller"␊
            ], (Controller) => {␊
                "use strict";␊
            ␊
                return Controller.extend("myApp.controller.Main", {␊
                    onInit() {␊
                        // Initialization code␊
                    },␊
                    onPress() {␊
                        // Button press handler␊
                    },␊
                });␊
            });␊
            \`\`\`␊
            ␊
            ### Scenario B: Instantiating a Controller Programmatically␊
            ␊
            This is a rarer use case where a controller instance is created manually in application logic, often for use without a corresponding view (e.g., a "headless" controller for managing application-wide logic).␊
            ␊
            **Key Characteristics of "Before" Code:**␊
            ␊
            * Uses \`var oController = sap.ui.controller('my.name.space.ControllerName');\`␊
            * The call is intended to immediately return a controller object.␊
            ␊
            #### Migration Steps␊
            ␊
            1. The modern replacement \`Controller.create()\` is **asynchronous** and returns a \`Promise\`. This is a critical change from the old synchronous API.␊
            2. Any code that relies on the controller instance must be placed within an \`async\` function and use the \`await\` keyword, or use the \`.then()\` Promise chain.␊
            3. The \`Controller.create()\` factory takes an object with a \`name\` property for the controller to be instantiated.␊
            ␊
            #### Example: Controller Instance Migration␊
            ␊
            **Before:**␊
            ␊
            \`\`\`js␊
            function createController() {␊
                return sap.ui.controller('myApp.controller.Main');␊
            }␊
            const oController = createController();␊
            ...␊
            \`\`\`␊
            ␊
            **After (using \`async/await\`):**␊
            ␊
            The calling code must be adapted to handle the asynchronous operation.␊
            ␊
            \`\`\`js␊
            async function createController() {␊
                return await Controller.create({name: "myApp.controller.Main"});␊
            }␊
            const oController = await createController();␊
            ...␊
            \`\`\`␊
            ␊
            ### Important Considerations for the Agent␊
            ␊
            * **Do not confuse \`extend\` and \`create\`**. \`extend\` is for defining a controller class blueprint. \`create\` is for manufacturing an object from that blueprint. The vast majority of migrations will involve \`Controller.extend\`.␊
            * **Respect Asynchronicity:** When encountering \`Controller.create\`, the agent must recognize the shift from synchronous to asynchronous programming. Simply replacing the call is not enough; the surrounding logic must be adapted to wait for the \`Promise\` to resolve. This might involve converting the enclosing function to an \`async\` function.␊
            * **Base Controllers:** If a controller is already using \`sap.ui.define\` but extending a custom base controller, ensure the path to the base controller is correct in the dependency array and that the base controller itself is properly defined using \`Controller.extend\`.␊
            * For more information, search the UI5 documentation for the topic "Controller".␊
